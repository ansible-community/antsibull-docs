ns.col2.extra connection
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The documentation for the connection plugin, ns.col2.extra, was malformed.

The errors were:

* ::

        3 validation errors for PluginDocSchema
        doc -> options -> host -> vars -> 0 -> extra
          extra fields not permitted (type=value_error.extra)
        doc -> options -> host -> extra
          extra fields not permitted (type=value_error.extra)
        doc -> extra
          extra fields not permitted (type=value_error.extra)


File a bug with the `ns.col2 collection <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/ns/col2/>`_ in order to have it corrected.
