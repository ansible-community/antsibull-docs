ns.col2.extra cliconf
+++++++++++++++++++++

The documentation for the cliconf plugin, ns.col2.extra, was malformed.

The errors were:

* ::

        1 validation error for PluginDocSchema
        doc -> extra
          Extra inputs are not permitted (type=extra_forbidden)


File a bug with the `ns.col2 collection <https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/ns/col2/>`_ in order to have it corrected.
