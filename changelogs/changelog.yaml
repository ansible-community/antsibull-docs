  0.1.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release. The ``antsibull-docs`` tool is compatible
        to the one from antsibull 0.43.0.
    fragments:
    - initial_release.yml
    release_date: '2022-04-06'
  1.0.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - From version 1.0.0 on, antsibull-docs is sticking to semantic versioning and
        aims at providing no backwards compatibility breaking changes **to the command
        line API (antsibull-docs)** during a major release cycle. We explicitly exclude
        code compatibility. **antsibull-docs is not supposed to be used as a library,**
        and when used as a library it might not conform to semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/2).
      minor_changes:
      - Only mention 'These are the collections with docs hosted on docs.ansible.com'
        for ``stable`` and ``devel`` subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/3).
      - Stop using some API from antsibull-core that is being removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/1).
      release_summary: First stable release.

    release_date: '2022-04-10'
  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that aliases of module/plugin options and return values that result
        in identical RST labels under docutil's normalization are only emitted once
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      - Properly escape module/plugin option and return value slugs in generated HTML
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/7).
      release_summary: Bugfix release.

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - If lookup plugins have a single return value starting with ``_``, that return
        value is now labelled ``Return value`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - If lookup plugins have an option called ``_terms``, it is now shown in its
        own section ``Terms``, and not in the regular ``Parameters`` section (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - More robust handling of parsing errors when ansible-doc was unable to extract
        documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support parameter type ``any``, and show ``raw`` as ``any`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      - Support test and filter plugins when ansible-core 2.14+ is used. This works
        with the current ``devel`` branch of ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/6).
      release_summary: Feature release with support for ansible-core 2.14's sidecar
        docs feature.

    - 1.1.0.yml
    - 6-tests-filters.yml
    release_date: '2022-05-03'
  1.10.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Explicitly declare the ``sh`` dependency and limit it to before 2.0.0. Also
        explicitly declare the dependencies on ``pydantic``, ``semantic_version``,
        ``aiohttp``, ``twiggy``, and ``PyYAML`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/99).
      - Restrict the ``pydantic`` dependency to major version 1 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/102).
      major_changes:
      - Support new semantic markup in documentation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/4).
      minor_changes:
      - Add a note about the ordering of positional and named parameter to the plugin
        page. Also mention positional and keyword parameters for lookups (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/101).
      - Update schema for roles argument spec to allow specifying attributes on the
        entrypoint level. These are now also rendered when present (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/103).
      release_summary: Bugfix and feature release.

    release_date: '2023-03-13'
  1.11.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Add support for semantic markup in roles (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/113).
      - Internal refactoring of markup code (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/108).
      - The ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand can be told not to run rstcheck when
        ``--plugin-docs`` is used by passing ``--skip-rstcheck``. This speeds up testing
        for large collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/112).
      - The ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand will now also validate Ansible markup
        when ``--plugin-docs`` is passed. It can also ensure that no semantic markup
        is used with the new ``--disallow-semantic-markup`` option. This can for example
        be used by collections to avoid semantic markup being backported to older
        stable branches (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/112).
      release_summary: Feature release.
    fragments:
    - 1.11.0.yml
    - 108-markup.yml
    - 112-validate-markup.yml
    - 113-semantic-markup-roles.yml
    release_date: '2023-03-27'
  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that ``_input`` does not show up twice for test or filter arguments
        when the plugin mentions it in ``positional`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/10).
      - Mark rstcheck 4.x and 5.x as compatible. Support rstcheck 6.x as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/13).
      minor_changes:
      - Support plugin ``seealso`` from the `semantic markup specification <https://hackmd.io/VjN60QSoRSSeRfvGmOH1lQ?both>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/8).
      - The ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand has a new boolean flag ``--plugin-docs``
        which renders the plugin docs to RST and validates them with rstcheck. This
        can be used as a lighter version of rendering the docsite in CI (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/12).
      - The files in the source repository now follow the `REUSE Specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`_.
        The only exceptions are changelog fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/14).

  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Do not escape ``<``, ``>``, ``&``, and ``'`` in JSONified defaults and examples
        as the `Jinja2 tojson filter <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#tojson>`_
        does. Also improve formatting by making sure ``,`` is followed by a space
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/18).
      - The collection filter was ignored when parsing the ``ansible-galaxy collection
        list`` output for the docs build (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/16,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/17).

    release_date: '2022-08-08'
  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Improve indentation of HTML blocks for tables to avoid edge cases which generate
        invalid RST (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/22).
      minor_changes:
      - Ensure that values for ``default``, ``choices``, and ``sample`` use the types
        specified for the option / return value (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/19).
      - If a plugin or module has requirements listed, add a disclaimer next to the
        installation line at the top that further requirements are needed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/23,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/24).
      - Show the 'you might already have this collection installed if you are using
        the ``ansible`` package' disclaimer for plugins only for official docsite
        builds (subcommands ``devel`` and ``stable``). Also include this disclaimer
        for roles on official docsite builds (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/25).
      - Use ``true`` and ``false`` for booleans instead of ``yes`` and ``no`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/116,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/19).
      - When processing formatting directives, make sure to properly escape all other
        text for RST respectively HTML instead of including it verbatim (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/21,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/22).

    release_date: '2022-08-16'
  1.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make handling of bad documentation more robust when certain values are ``None``
        while the keys are present (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/32).
      minor_changes:
      - The ``sphinx-init`` subcommand now also creates an ``antsibull-docs.cfg``
        file and moves configuration settings from CLI flags in ``build.sh`` to this
        configuration file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/26).
      - There are two new options for explicitly specified configuration files named
        ``collection_url`` and ``collection_install``. These allow to override the
        URLs pointing to collections (default link to galaxy.ansible.com), and the
        commands to install collections (use ``ansible-galaxy collection install``
        by default). This can be useful when documenting (internal) collections that
        are not available on Ansible Galaxy. The default ``antsibull-docs.cfg`` generated
        by the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand shows how this can be configured (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/15,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/26).
      - When generating plugin error pages, or showing non-fatal errors in plugins
        or roles, link to the collection's issue tracker instead of the collection's
        URL if available (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/29).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix escaping of collection names in version added statements, and fix collection
        names for roles options (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/34).
      minor_changes:
      - Detect filter and test plugin aliases and avoid them being emitted multiple
        times. Instead insert redirects so that stub pages will be created (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/33).
      - Replace ``ansible.builtin`` with ``ansible-core``, ``ansible-base``, or ``Ansible``
        in version added collection names. Also write ``<collection_name> <version>``
        instead of ``<version> of <collection_name>`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/34).

  1.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Avoid collection names with ``_`` in them appear wrongly escaped in the HTML
        output (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/41).
      - For INI examples which have no default, write ``VALUE`` as intended instead
        of ``None`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).
      - Format lists correctly for INI examples (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).
      - The ``sphinx-init`` subcommand's ``requirement.txt`` file avoids Sphinx 5.2.0.post0,
        which triggers a bug in sphinx-rtd-theme which happens to be the parent theme
        of the default theme sphinx_ansible_theme used by ``sphinx-init`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/39,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/40).
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to specify choices as dictionary instead of list (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/36).
      - Use JSON serializer to format choices (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).
      - Use special serializer to format INI values in examples (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/37).

  1.7.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Avoid long aliases list to make left column too wide (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/issues/1101,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/54).
      - Make ``lint-collection-docs --plugin-docs`` subcommand actually work (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/47).
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``--intersphinx`` option to the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand to allow adding
        additional ``intersphinx_mapping`` entries to ``conf.py`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/35,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/44).
      - Allow the ``toctree`` entries for in a collection's ``docs/docsite/extra-docs.yml``
        to be a dictionary with ``ref`` and ``title`` keys instead of just a reference
        as a string (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/45).
      - Antsibull-docs now depends on `packaging <https://pypi.org/project/packaging/>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/49).
      - The collection index pages now contain the supported versions of ansible-core
        of the collection in case collection's ``meta/runtime.yml`` specifies ``requires_ansible``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/48, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/49).
      - The output of the ``lint-collection-docs`` command has been improved; in particular
        multi-line messages are now indented (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/52).
      - Use ``ansible --version`` to figure out ansible-core version when ansible-core
        is not installed for the same Python interpreter / venv that is used for antsibull-docs
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/50).
      - Use code formatting for all values, such as choice entries, defaults, and
        samples (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/38, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/42).

        sphinx-init`` since the bug in ``sphinx-rtd-theme`` has been fixed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/69).
      - The license header for the template for the ``rst/index.rst`` file created
        by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` was commented incorrectly and thus showed
        up in the templated file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/67).
      - When using ``--squash-hierarchy``, do not mention the list of collections
        on the collection's index page (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/72).

  1.8.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that ``build.sh`` created by the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand sets
        proper permissions for antsibull-docs on the ``temp-rst`` directory it creates
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/79).
      minor_changes:
      - Add new options ``--project``, ``--copyright``, ``--title``, ``--html-short-title``,
        ``--extra-conf``, ``--extra-html-context``, and ``--extra-html-theme-options``
        to the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand to allow to customize the generated ``conf.py``
        Sphinx configuration (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/77).
      - Automatically use a module's or plugin's short description as the "See also"
        description if no description is provided (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/64,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/74).
      - It is now possible to provide a path to an existing file to be used as ``rst/index.rst``
        for ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/68).
      - Make compatible with antsibull-core 2.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/78).
      - Remove support for ``forced_action_plugin``, a module attribute that was removed
        during the development phase of attributes (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/63).
      - Stop mentioning the version features were added for Ansible if the Ansible
        version is before 2.7 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/76).
      - The default ``index.rst`` created by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` includes
        the new environment variable index (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/80).
      - Use correct markup (``envvar`` role) for environment variables. Compile an
        index of all environment variables used by plugins (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/73).

      bugfixes:
      - Fix the new options ``--extra-html-context`` and ``--extra-html-theme-options``
        of the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/86).

  1.9.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Improve build script generated by ``antsibull-docs sphinx-init`` to change
        to the directory where the script is located, instead of hardcoding the script's
        path. This also fixed the existing bug that the path was not quoted (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/91,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/92).
      - Show callback plugin type on callback plugin pages. Also write callback indexes
        by callback plugin type (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/89,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/90).

  2.0.0a1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - 'Disable flatmapping for all collections except community.general < 6.0.0
        and community.network < 5.0.0. You can enable flatmapping for your collection
        by setting ``flatmap: true`` in ``docs/docsite/config.yml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/134).'
      - Drop support for Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/115)."
      - No longer removes ``PYTHONPATH`` from the environment when calling ``ansible``,
        ``ansible-galaxy``, or ``ansible-doc`` outside a self-created venv (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/121).
      - No longer supports Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, and ansible-core 2.11 and
        2.12. The minimum required ansible-core version is 2.13. This allows for simpler
        and more efficient docs parsing and information retrieval (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/120).
      - The ``ansible-doc`` and ``ansible-internal`` values for ``doc_parsing_backend``
        in the configuration file have been removed. Change the value to ``auto``
        for best compatibility (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/120).
      bugfixes:
      - Use ``doc_parsing_backend`` from the application context instead of the library
        context. This prevents removal of ``doc_parsing_backend`` from the antsibull-core
        library context (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/125).
      major_changes:
      - Change pyproject build backend from ``poetry-core`` to ``hatchling``. ``pip
        install antsibull-docs`` works exactly the same as before, but some users
        may be affected depending on how they build/install the project (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/115).
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to use the currently installed ansible-core version for the ``devel``
        and ``stable`` subcommands (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/121).
      - Ansibull-docs now no longer depends directly on ``sh`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/122).
      - Now depends antsibull-core 2.0.0 or newer; antsibull-core 1.x.y is no longer
        supported (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/122).
      - Remove residual compatability code for Python 3.6 and 3.7 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pulls/70).
      - Support a per-collection docs config file ``docs/docsite/config.yml``. It
        is also linted by the ``lint-collection-docs`` subcommand (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/134).
      - The antsibull-docs requirement in the ``requirements.txt`` file created by
        the sphinx-init subcommand now has version range ``>= 2.0.0, < 3.0.0`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/126).
      - The dependency `antsibull-docs-parser <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-parser>`__
        has been added and is used for processing Ansible markup (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/124).
