  - "Fix FQCN detection (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/214)."

  - "The ``collection`` subcommand claimed to support paths to directories, which was never supported. Removed the mention of paths from the help, and added validation (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/214)."
