bugfixes:
  - "Using the new util from ``antsibull-fileutils >= 1.3.0`` to prevent copying the collections tree into a temporary directory structure that already lives inside a ``ansible_collections`` tree, which triggers a bug in ansible-core (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/391)."
