minor_changes:
  - "The ``sphinx-init`` subcommand now also creates an ``antsibull-docs.cfg`` file and moves configuration settings from CLI flags in ``build.sh`` to this configuration file (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/26)."
  - "There are two new options for explicitly specified configuration files named ``collection_url`` and ``collection_install``.
     These allow to override the URLs pointing to collections (default link to galaxy.ansible.com),
     and the commands to install collections (use ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` by default).
     This can be useful when documenting (internal) collections that are not available on Ansible Galaxy.
     The default ``antsibull-docs.cfg`` generated by the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand shows how this can be configured
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/15, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/26)."
