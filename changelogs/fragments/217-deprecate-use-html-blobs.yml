deprecated_features:
  - "The ``--use-html-blobs`` feature that inserts HTML blobs for the options and return value
     tables for the ``ansible-docsite`` output format is deprecated and will be removed soon.
     The HTML tables cause several features to break, such as references to options and return
     values. If you think this feature needs to stay, please create an issue in the `antsibull-docs
     repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/issues/>`__ and provide
     good reasons for it
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/217)."
