  - Change pyproject build backend from ``poetry-core`` to ``hatchling``.
    ``pip install antsibull-docs`` works exactly the same as before,

    project
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/115).

  - Drop support for Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/115)."
