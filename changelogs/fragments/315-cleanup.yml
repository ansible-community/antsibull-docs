minor_changes:
  - "Most documentation generating subcommands now have a ``--cleanup`` parameter which allows to delete
     files and directories that were not created by antsibull-docs in the destination directory
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/315)."
  - "No longer use ``rsync`` when creating a build script with the ``sphinx-init`` subcommand
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/pull/315)."
